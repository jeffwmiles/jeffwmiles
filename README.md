### Hello! 👋

<!--
**jeffwmiles/jeffwmiles** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Welcome to my profile! I am a system administrator, cloud administrator, technical architect, and wizard who loves to find and create new ways of making things work with magic rather than manual labour. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on automating monolithic infrastructure in Azure in smart and incremental ways
- 🌱 I’m currently learning every day, all the time, in a wide scope
- 💬 Ask me about Azure and Terraform
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Disc golf is a current passion of mine
